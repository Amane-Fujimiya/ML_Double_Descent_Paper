	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an effective, low-cost, non-intrusive technique often used for chemical identification. Typical approaches are based on matching observations to a reference database, which requires careful preprocessing, or supervised machine learning, which requires a fairly large number of training observations from each class. We propose a new machine learning technique for Raman spectrum matching, based on contrastive representation learning, that requires no preprocessing and works with as little as a single reference spectrum from each class. On three datasets we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves or is on par with the state of the art in prediction accuracy, and we show how to compute conformal prediction sets with specified frequentist coverage. Based on our findings, we believe contrastive representation learning is a promising alternative to existing methods for Raman spectrum matching.},

Raman spectroscopy provides a promising solution for quickly and non-destructively analyzing the biochemical composition of fish by associating Raman spectra with biochemical reference data using machine learning regression models. This paper investigates different regression models to address this task and proposes a new design of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for jointly predicting water, protein, and lipids yield. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a successful study employing CNNs to analyze the biochemical composition of fish based on a very small Raman spectroscopic dataset. Our approach combines a tailored CNN architecture with the comprehensive data preparation procedure, effectively mitigating the challenges posed by extreme data scarcity. The results demonstrate that our CNN can significantly outperform two state-of-the-art CNN models and multiple traditional machine learning models, paving the way for accurate and automated analysis of fish biochemical composition.},

Here, we propose the integration of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with low-resolution Raman spectroscopy with a portable hand-held spectrometer to facilitate concurrent spectral analysis and compound classification. Portable spectrometers generally have a lower resolution, and the Raman signal is usually buried under the background noise. The GAN-based model could not only generate high-resolution data but also reduced the spectral noise significantly. The generated data was used further to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based model for the classification of organic and pharmaceutical drug molecules. The high-resolution generated Raman data was subsequently used for spectral barcoding for identification of the pharmaceutical drugs. GAN also demonstrated enhanced robustness in extracting weak signals compared to conventional noise removal methods. This integrated system holds the potential for achieving accurate and real-time monitoring of noisy inputs to obtain high throughput output, thereby opening new avenues for applications in different domains. This synergy between spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) facilitates improved data processing, noise reduction, and feature extraction and opens avenues for predictive modeling and automated decision-making using cost-effective portable devices.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted extensive attention due to their unique characteristics and application potentials. Raman spectroscopy, as a rapid and non-destructive probe, exhibits distinct features and holds notable advantages in the structural characterization of 2D materials. However, traditional data analysis of Raman spectra relies on manual interpretation and feature extraction, which are both time-consuming and subjective. In this work, we employ deep learning techniques, including classificatory and generative deep learning, to assist the analysis of Raman spectra of typical 2D materials. For the limited and unevenly distributed Raman spectral data, we propose a data augmentation approach based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to augment the training dataset and construct a four-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 2D material classification. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DDPM in addressing data limitations and significantly improved classification model performance. The proposed DDPM-CNN method shows high reliability, with 100\%classification accuracy.

We investigate the effects of the size and number of convolution filters on the extracted regions for Raman-peak signals using the Lorentzian spectra. It is confirmed that the Raman peak contributes to the recognition by visualizing the extracted features. A near-zero weight value is obtained at the background level region, which appears to be used for baseline correction. Common component extraction is confirmed by an evaluation of numerically mixed amino acid spectra. High weight values at the common peaks and negative values at the distinctive peaks appear, even though the model is given one-hot vectors as the training labels (without a mix ratio). This proposed method is potentially suitable for applications such as the validation of trained models, ensuring the reliability of common component extraction from compound samples for spectral analysis.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an analytical method frequently used in the fields of materials science and general chemistry, which measures the characteristic responses of molecules to light. Being a non-destructive technique, it has many scientific and industrial applications, such as material identification, drug production and airport security. By combining Raman spectroscopy with machine learning, powerful tools can be developed to make accurate predictions on unknown substances or quantities, without explicit programming.

This thesis focuses on two main areas. Firstly, through the application of machine learning and image processing, a novel tool was developed to study single molecule interactions with metal surfaces using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). A convolutional autoencoder (CAE) architecture was utilised in a processing pipeline alongside various image processing techniques to extract and isolate complex, transient Raman features from SERS data. This was followed by a clustering process to obtain representative events pertaining to atomic-scale metal-molecule interactions on multiple catalyst surfaces, which provided a unique insight into the formation dynamics of atomic-scale features. The process was extended through the use of a Siamese convolutional neural network (Siamese-CNN) to incorporate spatiotemporal information relating to interactions between individual vibrational modes. This foundational research paves the way for tailoring metal-molecule interactions and assists in rational heterogeneous catalyst design. It introduces an analytical tool capable of studying metal-molecule interactions under the influence of strong local field gradients. This is a scenario that cannot be efficiently modelled with the conventional quantum mechanical method, density functional theory (DFT), which assumes a homogeneous field when analysing electronic structures of molecules.

Secondly, machine learning analysis has been applied to Raman data obtained in both nuclear and biopharmaceutical industrial applications. A key focus of this work is on the practical challenges faced in the design of data processing tasks and machine learning architectures due to real-world limitations in data collection. A fully connected (FC) autoencoder is employed as part of a regression task, which generates predictions on analyte concentrations in mixed substances. The method was shown to outperform industry standard regression tools, principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) regression, each used as comparative benchmarks, by over 50\% in a test of model precision across various datasets in the investigated industrial applications. Advancements in the precision, speed and effectiveness of such tools are of critical importance in an industrial environment. This is driven by compelling motivations to reduce not only the costs associated with these procedures, but also to increase the quality of resulting products, or to reduce the risks within industrial operations, where applicable.},

The existing methods cannot distinguish between different acid types and their strengths. In this study, an improved solution Raman detection platform is fabricated. The direct measurement of dissolved acetic acid, a kind of low molecular acids, is observed in transformer oil without extraction. The Raman shift line of oil-dissolved acetic acid at 891 cm−1 corresponding to H–C–H symmetrical swing and O–H swing modes is taken as its characteristic value. Taking Raman shift line of pure oil at 932 cm−1 as an internal standard, a linear regression curve for quantitative analysis is obtained with a slope of 0.19. The best platform parameter of accumulation number is 300, which is determined by Allan deviation analysis. The current concentration detection limit and accuracy for oil-dissolved acetic acid are obtained at about 0.68 mg/mL and 91.66\%, separately. The results show that Raman spectroscopy could be a useful alternative method for evaluation insulation aging state of an operating power transformer in the future.},

	abstract = {Tumour cells exhibit altered metabolic pathways that lead to radiation resistance and disease progression. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a label-free optical modality that can monitor post-irradiation biomolecular signatures in tumour cells and tissues. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) perform automated feature extraction directly from data, with classification accuracy exceeding that of traditional machine learning, in cases where data is abundant and feature extraction is challenging. We are interested in developing a CNN-based predictive model to characterize clinical tumour response to radiation therapy based on their degree of radiosensitivity or radioresistance. In this work, a CNN architecture is built for identifying post-irradiation spectral changes in Raman spectra of tumour tissue. The model was trained to classify irradiated versus non-irradiated tissue using Raman spectra of breast tumour xenografts. The CNN effectively classified the tissue spectra, with accuracies exceeding 92.1\% for data collected 3 days post-irradiation, and 85.0\% at day 1 post-irradiation. Furthermore, the CNN was evaluated using a leave-one-out- (mouse, section or Raman map) validation approach to investigate its generalization to new test subjects. The CNN retained good predictive accuracy (average accuracies 83.7\%, 91.4\%, and 92.7\%, respectively) when little to no information for a specific subject was given during training. Finally, the classification performance of the CNN was compared to that of a previously developed model based on group and basis restricted non-negative matrix factorization and random forest (GBR-NMF-RF) classification. We found that CNN yielded higher classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in mice assessed 3 days post-irradiation, as compared with the GBR-NMF-RF approach. Overall, the CNN can detect biochemical spectral changes in tumour tissue at an early time point following irradiation, without the need for previous manual feature extraction. This study lays the foundation for developing a predictive framework for patient radiation response monitoring.},

This sort of fingerprinting molecules has thus led to widespread application of Raman spectrum in various fields like medical dignostics, forensics, mineralogy, bacteriology and virology etc. Despite the recent rise in Raman spectra data volume, there has not been any significant effort in developing generalized machine learning methods for Raman spectra analysis. We examine, experiment and evaluate existing methods and conjecture that neither current sequential models nor traditional machine learning models are satisfactorily sufficient to analyze Raman spectra. Both has their perks and pitfalls, therefore we attempt to mix the best of both worlds and propose a novel network architecture RamanNet. RamanNet is immune to invariance property in CNN and at the same time better than traditional machine learning models for the inclusion of sparse connectivity. Our experiments on 4 public datasets demonstrate superior performance over the much complex state-of-the-art methods and thus RamanNet has the potential to become the defacto standard in Raman spectra data analysis},

	abstract = {Head and neck cancers, which encompass a range of malignancies affecting the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx, are critical to address due to their high morbidity and impact on quality of life. This underscores the need for effective and non-invasive diagnostic tools. Raman spectroscopy-based liquid biopsy detects cancers by analyzing intrinsic Raman fingerprints in biofluids without the need for molecular labels, making it a promising point-of-care screening method. However, Raman scattering is weak, and interpreting spectra from biological samples is challenging due to overlapping peaks, fluorescence background, cosmic rays, and instrument noise, which obscure the signal. Extensive preprocessing and advanced analytical techniques are usually needed to isolate the true Raman signal. While machine learning models have shown promise in classifying cancer status from Raman spectra, variations in Raman systems, lack of standardized protocols, and small patient cohorts limit their clinical utility. Our goal is to develop a model for Raman spectroscopy-based liquid biopsy that generalizes across different measurement conditions and clinical indications. A key challenge is the high cost of acquiring extensive labeled training data. To overcome this, we use a Siamese-based, self-supervised model trained on unlabeled spectral data. The model generates synthetic spectra that mimic real variations across Raman systems and measurement protocols by preprocessing the input and adding simulated factors like fluorescence background, noise, and cosmic rays. By maximizing the cosine similarity between the embeddings of the generated spectra and their originals, the model learns meaningful features of the Raman spectra. This approach not only expands the training set but also enhances the model’s stability across different instruments. In our preliminary study, we analyzed thousands of Raman spectra measured on liquid biopsy specimens (blood plasma and saliva) collected from a cohort of 71 head and neck cancer patients (spread across early and late-stage disease) and 44 non-cancerous controls. Spectra were divided into training and test sets with an 80:20 ratio. Each specimen was drop cast onto a quartz substrate and 25 repeated Raman point scans were performed in a grid over the dried spot. We augmented the training set to reach 9,200 spectra, and t-SNE plots of the embeddings of the test set (1,150 spectra) showed clear clustering separated by sample type, with distinct clusters for healthy individuals and cancer patients. Despite the excellent performance for cancer vs control, separation among cancer patients at different stages remains limited, but will be the target of future work building on this study. These results suggest that our label-free approach can effectively distinguish between healthy and cancerous samples using unlabeled data, advancing the potential for the widespread clinical application of Raman-based liquid biopsy powered by machine learning.Citation Format: Yifei Gu, Kwan Lun Chiu, Andrés Muñoz-Jaramillo, Andrew C.

	abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study was to develop a robust method for rapid detection and identification of the virus based on Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning approach.
Methods
We have used saliva spiked with different bacterial viruses such as P1 Phage, M13 Phage, and Lambda Phage, for demonstrating the utility of this method for virus detection. The Raman spectra collected from a large number of independent samples, each of different phages with and without saliva were used to train a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) with its hyperparameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. The CNN method was not only able to detect the presence of a phage but was also able to identify the phage type using unprocessed Raman spectra having high noise. In addition, a semi-supervised auto-encoder was utilized for differentiating healthy saliva from saliva spiked with phages thereby making it possible to detect the presence of phages in saliva samples.
Results
The CNN could identify the virus with an accuracy of 98.86\% based on ten-fold cross-validation, precision of 98.8\%, recall of 98.7\%, and F1 score of 98.7\%. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.99. Autoencoder was capable of differentiating healthy saliva from the virus spiked saliva with an accuracy of 99.7\% in a semi-supervised manner. Thus, Raman spectroscopy coupled with machine learning approach was able to directly detect and identify the virus without consuming time for lengthy sample processing.
Conclusion
A robust method based on Raman spectroscopy coupled with machine learning may be capable of detection and identification of the virus even from the signal with low intensity and high noise. This label-free method is fast, sensitive, specific, and cost effective.},

	abstract = {Animal blood and semen analysis plays a significant role in national biological resource management, wildlife conservation, and customs security quarantine. Traditional blood analysis methods have disadvantages, such as complex sample preparation, time consumption, and false positives. Therefore, proposing a rapid and highly accurate analysis method is highly valuable. Raman spectroscopy has been widely used in blood analysis, and efficient and accurate analysis results can be obtained through the machine learning algorithm feature extraction. Recently, the transformer network structure was applied to Raman spectroscopy recognition. However, the multihead self-attention mechanism does not perform well in extracting local feature peaks, although it obtains global feature relations. This paper proposes a neural network based on the combination of one-dimensional convolution and multihead self-attention mechanism (Raman ConvMSANet) to identify 52 species of blood and semen Raman spectra. The network can achieve reliable identification effects in multiclassification and sample imbalance situations, and the average identification accuracy of blood and semen can reach more than 98.5\%. The proposed network model can be applied not only to blood and semen identification but also to other biological fields.},

Exploring new approaches to facilitate Raman spectroscopy and analysis has become an area of intensifying focus for research. It has been demonstrated that machine learning techniques can more efficiently extract valuable information from spectral data, creating unprecedented opportunities for analytical science. This paper outlines traditional and more recently developed statistical methods that are commonly used in machine learning (ML) and ML-algorithms for different Raman spectroscopy-based classification and recognition applications. The methods include Principal Component Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, as well as neural network-based deep learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc. The bulk of the review is dedicated to the research advances in machine learning applied to Raman spectroscopy from several fields, including material science, biomedical applications, food science, and others, which reached impressive levels of analytical accuracy. The combination of Raman spectroscopy and machine learning offers unprecedented opportunities to achieve high throughput and fast identification in many of these application fields. The limitations of current studies are also discussed and perspectives on future research are provided.},

abstract = {Rapid identification of marine pathogens is very important in marine ecology. Artificial intelligence combined with Raman spectroscopy is a promising choice for identifying marine pathogens due to its rapidity and efficiency. However, considering the cost of sample collection and the challenging nature of the experimental environment, only limited spectra are typically available to build a classification model, which hinders qualitative analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to classify marine pathogens by means of Raman spectroscopy combined with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Three marine strains, namely, Staphylococcus hominis, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Bacillus licheniformis, were cultured. Using Raman spectroscopy, we acquired 100 spectra of each strain, and we fitted them into GAN models for training. After 30,000 training iterations, the spectra generated by G were similar to the actual spectra, and D was used to test the accuracy of the spectra. Our results demonstrate that our method not only improves the accuracy of machine learning classification but also solves the problem of requiring a large amount of training data. Moreover, we have attempted to find potential identifying regions in the Raman spectra that can be used for reference in subsequent related work in this field. Therefore, this method has tremendous potential to be developed as a tool for pathogen identification.}

abstract = {Neural network methods have been widely used in many fields of scientific research with the rapid increase of computing power. The physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received much attention as a major breakthrough in solving partial differential equations using neural networks. In this paper, a resampling technique based on the expansion-shrinkage point (ESP) selection strategy is developed to dynamically modify the distribution of training points in accordance with the performance of the neural networks. In this new approach both training sites with slight changes in residual values and training points with large residuals are taken into account. In order to make the distribution of training points more uniform, the concept of continuity is further introduced and incorporated. This method successfully addresses the issue that the neural network becomes ill or even crashes due to the extensive alteration of training point distribution. The effectiveness of the improved physics-informed neural networks with expansion-shrinkage resampling is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments.}

	abstract = {As a crucial nonlinear phenomenon, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) plays multifaceted roles involved in forward and inverse problems. In fibre-optic systems, these roles range from detrimental interference that impairs optical performance to beneficial effects that enables various devices such as Raman amplifier. To obtain solutions of SRS, various numerical methods customized for different scenarios have been proposed. However, these methods are time-consuming, low-efficiency, and experience-orientated, particularly in combined scenarios consisting of both forward and inverse problems. Inspired by physics-informed neural networks, we propose SRS-Net, which combines the efficient automatic differentiation and powerful representation ability of neural networks with the regularization of SRS physical laws, to obtain universal solutions for SRS of forward, inverse, and combined problems. We showcase the intuitive solving procedure and high-speed performance of SRS-Net through extensive simulations covering different scenarios. Additionally, we validate its capabilities in experiments involving the high-fidelity modelling of a wavelength division multiplexing system spanning the C + L-band with approximately 10 THz. The versatility of the SRS-Net framework extends beyond SRS, indicating its potential as a promising universal solution in other engineering problems with nonlinear dynamics governed by partial differential equations.},

abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique for structure characterization. For a protein hosted in a reversed micellar medium, the spectral features of the protein are always interfered by the IR absorption bands of the medium in addition to the congestion in their IR spectra. Fortunately, there is a transparent window in the 2500–2200cm−1 region. Incorporation of a vibrational probe with IR absorption frequencies in this region into proteins represents a promising strategy for the study of the conformation of a protein in a reverse micelle. In the present work, we incorporated 4-cyanobenzyl group (CN) into bovine serum albumin (BSA) via cysteine alkylation reactions under mild conditions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the CN modified BSA (CNBSA) could retain its conformation. When CNBSA was hosted in AOT reverse micelle, it was found that the nitrile group on BSA was sensitive to the conformational change of BSA induced by urea as an additive in the reverse micelle. The peak splitting of nitrile group was also observed when the size of AOT reverse micelle and the concentration of an electrolyte were varied. Obviously, the shift of the IR absorption peak and/or peak splitting of nitrile group on BSA are correlated with the change of BSA conformation in AOT reverse micelle. So we conclude that the nitrile infrared probe can be used to study protein conformation in a reverse micelle.}
